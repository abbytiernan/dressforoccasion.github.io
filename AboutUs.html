		<p>
			Two Dublin, Ireland-based lifelong friends made the decision to make their mutual love of fashion into something truly remarkable in 2003. 
			As children, we always had a sense of style and a talent for dressing to the nines for a school function, a family wedding, or a fun night out. 
			Making original clothes for ourselves and our closest friends as a hobby quickly developed into a business idea. 
			After our day jobs, we sewed late into the night and drew sketches at the kitchen table. 
			Our first "store" consisted of a small booth at the neighbourhood market where we proudly showcased our handcrafted gowns.
